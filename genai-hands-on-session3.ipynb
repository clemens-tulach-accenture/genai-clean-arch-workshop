      "**Business Logic Leakage / Business Logic in Controller**\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Why it violates Clean Architecture principles:**  \n",
      "According to the core principles, **Controllers** should act as mere request handlers or gateways that delegate all business logic to the appropriate domain or application layer. Including logic like:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Filtering or decision-making about eligibility**\n",
      "- **Applying discounts or business rules**\n",

      "\n",
      "- Deciding which orders are eligible (`findEligibleForDiscount()`)\n",

      "### 4. **Impact on maintainability and testability:**  \n",
      "- **Decreased maintainability:** Business rules scattered within controllers make it harder to update logic consistently.\n",
      "- **Poor testability:** It becomes more difficult to write isolated unit tests for business rules since they are embedded in the controller. Tests for the controller will involve duplicate or complex setup for business logic.\n",
      "- ** Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** The controller handles both request processing and business rules, increasing complexity.\n",
      "\n",

      "  - Introduce a **Domain Service** (e.g., `OrderPricingService`) that handles eligibility checks, discount calculations, and other business rules.\n",
      "  - The service exposes methods like `getEligibleOrders()` which encapsulate all business logic.\n",

      "- **Controller should only:**  \n",

      "    @GetMapping(\"/orders/eligible\")\n",
      "    public List<Order> getEligibleOrders() {\n",

      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "  - Receive pre-processed data, not implement logic directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **For Violation 2 (Validation):**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Move validation to domain entities or application service:**  \n",
      "  - For example, before saving an order, invoke a **validation method** in the domain model or a dedicated validation service:\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    orderValidationService.validate(order);\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "  - Or, embed validation rules within the `Order` entity:\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    public class Order {\n",
      "        public void validate() {\n",
      "            if (total < 0) throw new BusinessException(\"Negative total\");\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
