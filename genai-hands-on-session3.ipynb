      "\n",
      "**Location:**\n",
      "- Class: `OrderController`\n",
      "- Method: `getEligibleOrders()` (lines within the method)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Details:**\n",
      "- The method retrieves a list of eligible orders from the repository and then applies additional business rules:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  for (Order order : eligibleOrders) {\n",
      "      if (order.getTotal() > 500) {\n",

      "      }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why it violates Clean Architecture:**\n",
      "- **Business logic is placed within the controller**, which should only handle HTTP request/response handling, and orchestrate calls to domain/business logic.\n",
      "- Applying discounts or any business decision (like VIP status) should reside in the domain or application layer, **not** in the interface layer.\n",
      "- It mixes concerns: the controller is not responsible for business rules; doing so couples the API to business logic, impairing scalability and testability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "- Difficult **to change or extend business rules**, as they are scattered in the API layer.\n",
      "- **Harder to write unit tests** for business logic since it's embedded in the controller.\n",
      "- Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to fix:**\n",
      "- Move this logic into a **Domain Service** or **Application Service**, e.g., `OrderService`.\n",

      "    return orderRepository.save(order);\n",

      "\n",
      "**Why it violates Clean Architecture:**\n",
      "- **Business validation logic (checking total >= 0)** is located directly in the controller.\n",
      "- Validation should be part of **domain rules**, possibly within the domain model (`Order`) itself, or encapsulated within a **Domain Service**.\n",
      "- The controller should only handle request parsing and response formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "- Embedding business validation in the API layer hampers **centralized enforcement** of business rules.\n",
      "- Validation logic becomes duplicated or inconsistent across endpoints if repeated.\n",
      "- Harder to **unit test business rules** independently from the API layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to fix:**\n",
      "- Move validation into the **domain model** (`Order`) as validation within the constructor or a validation method.\n",
      "- Alternatively, use a **validation service** that is invoked before persistence.\n",
