      "According to Clean Architecture principles, Controllers should be thin and delegate all business logic to the domain or application layer. Here, the controller not only retrieves data but also applies business rules (e.g., applying VIP discount logic), violating the separation of concerns. This makes the controller responsible for business decisions, which traditionally belong to a domain or service layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact on maintainability and testability:**  \n",
      "- Harder to unit test business logic separately.\n",

      "- Mixing of concerns can introduce bugs when business rules change.\n",

      "**How to fix:**  \n",
      "- Move the logic for determining eligible orders and applying discounts into a domain service or use-case class.  \n",

    "1. **Current Pain Points:**\n",
    "   - Which violations are most common in your codebase?\n",
    "   - Where does business logic leak most often?\n",
    "   - Main refactoring challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adoption Strategy:**\n",
    "   - Start with workflows for automated checks\n",
    "   - Use RAG for education and training\n",
    "   - Deploy agents for complex legacy code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Track violation frequency over time\n",
    "   - Measure time saved in code reviews\n",
    "   - Monitor architecture debt reduction\n",
