      "- **Impact:**\n",
      "  - **Maintainability:** Difficult to change business rules, as they are scattered in controllers.\n",
      "  - **Testability:** Harder to test business logic in isolation; tests must go through the interface.\n",
      "- **How to Fix:**\n",
      "  - Move this logic into a domain service, e.g., `OrderService`, with a method like `getEligibleOrdersForDiscount()`.\n",
      "  - The controller should simply call this service, which encapsulates all business rules.\n",

      "- Class: (not specified, but implied to be a REST controller)\n",
      "- Method: `createOrder()` (lines 1-7)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Violation:**\n",
      "- **Type:** Business validation in controller\n",
      "- **Details & Explanation:**\n",
      "  - The controller directly performs a business validation (`if (order.getTotal() < 0)`) before saving.\n",
      "  - Business validations, such as ensuring total is non-negative, belong in the domain layer, e.g., in the `Order` entity through validation annotations or in a domain service.\n",
      "  - Placing validation logic here violates the principle that the interface layer should not contain business rules; it should delegate to domain/domain validation.\n",
      "- **Impact:**\n",
      "  - **Maintainability:** Validation logic duplicated or inconsistent if scattered.\n",
      "  - **Testability:** Validation rules are harder to test independently of presentation.\n",
      "- **How to Fix:**\n",
      "  - Move validation into the domain model, e.g., add validation annotations on `Order`, or implement in a domain service.\n",
      "  - The controller simply invokes `orderRepository.save()`, relying on domain rules to enforce consistency.\n",

      "### **Summary of Violations:\n",
      "| Location | Issue | Why violation occurs | Impact | Fix |\n",
      "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
      "| `OrderController.getEligibleOrders()` | Business logic leakage (discount logic based on total) | Controllers should not contain business rules; move to domain service | Reduced maintainability/testability | Move discount logic to a domain service layer (e.g., `OrderService`) |\n",
      "| Order creation method | Business validation for total < 0 | Validation belongs in domain layer, not in controller | Harder to maintain/scale validation, testing issues | Implement validation within `Order` entity or domain layer | |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "All identified violations stem from placing business rules (discount logic and validation) in the interface layer. According to Clean Architecture, these should be moved into domain services or domain entities to preserve separation of concerns, improving overall maintainability and testability.\n"
