      "The analysis reveals several violations of Clean Architecture principles across the layers:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Order Controller Violations:**\n",
      "- **Business logic leakage:** The controller performs business decisions, such as applying discounts and approving high-value orders, which should reside within domain or application services. Controllers should primarily handle HTTP requests and delegate business rules elsewhere.\n",
      "- **Impact on maintainability:** Embedding business logic in controllers makes the system harder to modify, test, and extend because changes to business rules require modifications in the presentation layer, increasing coupling and reducing clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Order Repository Violations:**\n",
      "- **Mixing data access with business logic:** The repository contains methods (`findEligibleForDiscount`) that perform filtering and mutating entities based on business rules, which belong in domain or service layers.\n",
      "- **Inline business logic and entity mutation:** Mutating entities (`order.setTotal`) within repository streams and including business criteria in queries violate separation of concerns.\n",
      "- **Impact on maintainability:** Embedding business logic in data access layers complicates testing and evolution of both persistence and business rules, leading to fragile code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Order Entity Violations:**\n",
      "- **Business logic in entity getters:** Calculating discounts inside getter methods (e.g., `getDiscountedTotal`) mixes domain data with presentation concerns.\n",
      "- **Impact on maintainability:** This approach breaks the principle that entities should represent pure data and behavior relevant to the domain. It can cause unintended side-effects and makes business rule modifications more complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Implications:**\n",
      "These violations lead to a tightly coupled, less modular system where changes in business rules require touching multiple layers, risking bugs and increasing development effort. Proper placement of business logic in domain or application services, keeping controllers as thin as possible, and avoiding side-effects in entities and repositories are recommended to improve maintainability and adherence to Clean Architecture.\u001b[0m\n",

      "#### Violation 1:\n",
      "- **What:** Business logic (applying special discounts based on order total) is embedded directly in an API controller.\n",
      "- **Why:** According to Clean Architecture, controllers should be mere entry points that instantiate requests and delegate to application or domain layers. Business rules should reside within domain models or use cases/services, not in interface-layer code.\n",
      "- **Result:** This introduces tight coupling between the web layer and business rules, reducing flexibility, testability, and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Violation 2:\n",
      "- **What:** Validation logic (rejecting negative totals) is embedded in the controller.\n",
      "- **Why:** Business validation should be performed within domain entities, domain services, or application services, not in presentation (controller) code.\n",
      "- **Result:** Mixing validation with presentation logic violates separation of concerns and makes it harder to modify or reuse validation rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Specific Architecture Rules Violated\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Rule 1:** *Controllers should not contain business rules or domain logic.*  \n",
      "  The application logic for discounts and business validation is directly handled in controllers rather than dedicated services or domain models.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Rule 2:** *Business validation should be encapsulated within domain models or domain services.*  \n",
      "  Validations like \"order total should not be negative\" are business constraints and should not be checked in controllers.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Rule 3:** *Use case or application layer should orchestrate business rules.*  \n",
      "  The current code violates this by handling discounts and validation inline.\n",

      "### 5. Refactoring Recommendations\n",

      "- **Layer Assignment:**\n",
      "  - **Business Rules & Validation:** Should reside within **Domain Models** or **Application Services/Use Cases**.\n",
      "  - **Controller:** Should only delegate requests to the application layer, passing along parameters, and returning results.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Specifically:**\n",
      "  - **For Discount Logic (e.g., high-value orders):**  \n",
      "    Create a **Domain Service** or **Order Aggregate** method that applies discounts. Eg., `Order.applyDiscounts()`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - **For Validation (e.g., negative total):**  \n",
      "    Encapsulate in the **Order** entity’s constructor or validation methods. For example:\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    public Order(BigDecimal total) {\n",
      "        if (total.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) < 0) {\n",
      "            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Negative total\");\n",
      "        }\n",
      "        this.total = total;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    or use a validator in a service layer before persisting.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Controller example after refactoring:**\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  @PostMapping(\"/orders\")\n",
      "  public Order createOrder(@RequestBody Order orderInput) {\n",
      "      orderService.validateOrder(orderInput);\n",

      "      return order;\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **In conclusion:**\n",
      "  - Move **business validation** and **business logic** out of controllers into **Domain Models** or **Application Services**.\n",
      "  - Keep controllers as simple orchestration layers, strictly adhering to Clean Architecture principles.\n",
